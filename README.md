# Comprehensive Analysis of Wholesale Customers Using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project explores the `Wholesale Customers Dataset` from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** to derive actionable insights about customer purchasing behavior. By applying `clustering`, `classification`, `feature engineering`, and `dimensionality reduction` techniques, we aim to:

- Segment customers into meaningful groups based on their spending patterns.
- Predict customer types (e.g., Horeca or Retail) using classification models.
- Identify key features that influence customer behavior to improve model accuracy and interpretability.
- Visualize findings to communicate insights effectively.

## Dataset Features

The dataset consists of the following features:
|
| **Channel**: Indicates the type of customer channel:
|1 = Horeca (Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe)
|2 = Retail
|**Region**: Geographic region of the customer:
|1 = Lisbon
|2 = Oporto
|3 = Other Region
|**Fresh**: Annual spending on fresh products (e.g., vegetables, fruits).
|**Milk**: Annual spending on milk products.
|**Grocery**: Annual spending on grocery items.
|**Frozen**: Annual spending on frozen products.
|**Detergents_Paper**: Annual spending on detergents, cleaning supplies, and paper products.
|**Delicatessen**: Annual spending on meats and delicatessen items.
