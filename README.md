# Comprehensive Analysis of Wholesale Customers Using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project explores the `Wholesale Customers Dataset` from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** to derive actionable insights about customer purchasing behavior. By applying `clustering`, `classification`, `feature engineering`, and `dimensionality reduction` techniques, we aim to:

- Segment customers into meaningful groups based on their spending patterns.
- Predict customer types (e.g., Horeca or Retail) using classification models.
- Identify key features that influence customer behavior to improve model accuracy and interpretability.
- Visualize findings to communicate insights effectively.
